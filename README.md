# Revolutionizing Climate Impact: Unveiling the Power of Carbon Credit Initiatives through Dynamic Time Series Analysis

## Introduction
In the race against climate change, businesses are embracing carbon credit projects to mitigate their environmental footprint. This study delves into time series analysis, comparing pre and post-implementation periods of carbon credit projects, aiming to unveil the transformative impact on emission patterns over time.

## Background
The greenhouse effect, primarily caused by greenhouse gases like Carbon Dioxide, contributes to global warming. Human activities, especially burning fossil fuels, exacerbate this effect. Carbon credits act as permits to emit a certain amount of CO2, allowing businesses and individuals to offset their emissions.

## Problem Statement
As businesses invest in carbon credit projects, assessing their efficacy becomes imperative. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive time series analysis to evaluate the influence of carbon credit initiatives on emission patterns over time.

## Objectives
1. Unveil Emission Trends
2. Explore Seasonal Patterns
3. Detect Anomalies
4. Investigate Correlations
5. Predict Future Impact
6. Quantify Transformation


### Stakeholders
Regulatory bodies, Investors, and Researchers are pivotal in assessing the effectiveness of carbon credit initiatives.

### Data Source
Datasets from authoritative bodies like IPCC, World Bank, United Nations, and Data.gov form the basis of analysis.

### Project Structure
1. Data Understanding
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Modelling
    - Base Model
    - Tuning & Further Modelling
    - Forecasting
6. Conclusions & Recommendations

## System requirements.
To follow along:

1. Ensure you have Python
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install requirements in the requirements.txt file
4. Run the Notebook.ipynb file

## Results
- Correlation analysis showed significant connections between variables.
- ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models provided insights into emission forecasts.
- Recommendations include implementing carbon pricing and promoting cleaner technologies.
